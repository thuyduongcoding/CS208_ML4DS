    "# Assignment 2: K-means clustering {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment aims at familiarizing you with training and testing K-means clustering model. You will have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the data.\n",
    "- Analyze the data.\n",
    "- Use Elbow method to determine the number of clusters K. Research the use of parameters of KElbowVisualizer function.\n",
    "- Train a K-means clustering model.\n",
    "- Perform cluster visualization in two ways:\n",
    "  - Apply PCA to perform dimensionality reduction: project data features into a three-dimensional space and two-dimensional space and visualize the clusters.\n",
    "  - Visualize the clusters using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE). T-SNE is a tool for visualizing high-dimensional data. T-SNE, based on stochastic neighbor embedding, is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to visualize data in a two or three dimensional space. Refernece: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html\n",
    "- Take some samples from each cluster and analyze their features to see the clusters' characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be working on is 'credit-card-holder-data.csv'. It is composed of attributes such as balance of the credit card, ammount of purchase, etc., to develop a customer segmentation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission {-}\n",
    "The structure of submission folder should be organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ./\\<StudentID>-assignment2-notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission folder is named ML4DS-\\<StudentID>-Assignment2 (e.g., ML4DS-2012345-Assigment2) and then compressed with the same name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Evaluation {-}\n",
    "Assignment evaluation will be conducted on how properly you handle the data for training the K-means model, evaluate the model performance, visualize customer clusters and analyze the cluster characteristics. In addition, your code should conform to a Python coding convention such as PEP-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadline {-}\n",
    "Please visit Canvas for details."
