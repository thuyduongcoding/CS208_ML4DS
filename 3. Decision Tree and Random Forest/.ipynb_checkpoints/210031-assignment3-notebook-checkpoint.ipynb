    "# Assignment 3: Decision Tree and Random Forest {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment aims at familiarizing you with training and testing Decision Tree and Random Forest classification model. Here are the BASIC requirements of the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the data.\n",
    "- Analyze the data.\n",
    "- Check if the data is imbalanced, possibly apply SMOTE to oversample or undersample data classes.\n",
    "- Use GridSearchCV to find the best Decision Tree and Random Forest.\n",
    "- Show the most important features.\n",
    "- Visualize the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be working on is 'data-employee-recruitment.csv'. It is composed of attributes such as employee gender, education level, company size, etc., to develop an employee recruitment prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission {-}\n",
    "The structure of submission folder should be organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ./\\<StudentID>-assignment3-notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission folder is named ML4DS-\\<StudentID>-Assignment3 (e.g., ML4DS-2012345-Assigment3) and then compressed with the same name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Evaluation {-}\n",
    "Assignment evaluation will be conducted on how you accomplish the assignment requirements. It is a plus if you have data exploration and modeling steps other than the basic requirements. In addition, your code should conform to a Python coding convention such as PEP-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadline {-}\n",
    "Please visit Canvas for details."
